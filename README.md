Drag and Drop Issues

This is an application that demonstrates the functionality of dragging and
dropping elements using the react-beautiful-dnd library. You can drag and move
different items between three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done".

Features

Drag and drop items between columns using the mouse or touchscreen. Change the
status of tasks by moving them between columns. Automatically save changes after
dragging items using Redux and Redux Persist. Use a search feature to search for
different repositories and load task lists from the GitHub API. Preserve the
application state between page refreshes using Redux Persist. Installation

Usage

On the main page, you will see three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and
"Done". Each column has a list of tasks. You can drag and move them between
columns. To load a task list from a GitHub repository, enter the repository URL
in the search field and click the "Search" button. After loading the task list
from GitHub, you can drag and move tasks between columns. Changes will be
automatically saved using Redux and Redux Persist, so they will persist after
page refreshes.

Enjoy the drag and drop functionality in the Drag and Drop Issues application!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
